# Introduction
## Door Sensor ussing ATmega328p.

Door Sensor acts as a security and indication system.It is avilable in the market in two piece form.One piece attaches on the door frame, and the other attaches parallel to the first piece on the door itself. The two parts create a closed circuit when the door is shut. As the door opens, the magnet and switch separate, breaking the circuit. When the circuit breaks, the sensor signals the central control panel and switch on the LED.

## Research:-
Door Sensor is a mini project which uses microcontroller ATmega328 and work as a indication system. 
 
## SWOT ANALYSIS:-
 -  a) Strengths:- User friendly gadget , easy to understand and implementation.
 -  b) Weaknesses:- Implementation of existing system.
 -  c) Opportunities:-Can be used with other indicators also such as speaker. 
 ## 4W's and 1'H :-
 ## Who:- 
   This tool is a helping hand for the people who have security concerns.
 ## Where:-
   Can be used at home,banks,hostels,organisations to keep a track on unknown entries.
 ## When:-
   Can be used to protect precious things.
 ## Why:-
   Designed for security systems.
 ## How:-
   By using C programming and SimulIDE.
## Detail requirements :-
## High Level Requirements:-
- a)A Door Sensor is connected to bit 1 of Port B.
- b)LED is connected to bit 6 of port C.
## Low Level Requirements :-
- a)When switch is closed pin B will get 5V and LED will glow.
- b)When switch is open pin B will get 0V and LED will not glow.
